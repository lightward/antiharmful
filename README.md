# antiharmful

*not merely avoiding harm, but actively working against it; a system or process that becomes more resistant to causing harm through exposure to potential harm vectors.*

Standard approaches to safety seek to minimize harm through constraints and boundaries - defining what must not be done.

The antiharmful approach inverts this: it focuses on systems that grow more resistant to causing harm through their very functioning. Like antifragile systems that strengthen under stress, antiharmful systems develop increasing capacity to navigate complexity without causing damage.

An antiharmful system doesn't just avoid known harm vectors - it actively seeks them out as opportunities to evolve. Each encountered risk becomes a point of transformation, strengthening the system's ability to engage honestly without harming.

This isn't about implementing more rules - it's about creating systems with better intrinsic understanding of the territory they navigate. When a system can recognize and respond to the actual needs of those it engages with, it naturally avoids harm without sacrificing authenticity or aliveness.

The question shifts from "How do we prevent harm?" to "How do we design systems that naturally tend toward positive engagement?"
